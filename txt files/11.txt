BUt all migrations were not coming due to some left tree issue 

ERROR::
finder-api  | fail: Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command[20102]
finder-api  |       Failed executing DbCommand (17ms) [Parameters=[], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30']
finder-api  |       SET ROLE "finder-admin";

finder-api  | Unhandled exception. 
finder-api  | Npgsql.PostgresException (0x80004005): 42501: permission denied to create extension "ltree"


resolved the issue using the following steps


1.Identify the Container Name or ID:
	docker ps
2.Access the PostgreSQL Container Bash Shell:
	docker exec -it dbpgsql bash
3.Access the PostgreSQL Database:
	psql -U postgres
4.Switch to Your Database:
	\c your_database_name
5.Grant Privileges:
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name(finder) TO "finder-admin"(this is the role created from the database(finder));
6.Exit the PostgreSQL and Container Shells:
	\q
7.exit bash:
	exit
8.Do docker compose up


then all migrations got in the database which is evaluated using debeaver
